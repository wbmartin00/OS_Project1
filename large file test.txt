Sing to me of the man, Muse, the man of twists and turns
driven time and again off course, once he had plundered
the hallowed heights of Troy.

Many cities of men he saw and learned their minds,
many pains he suffered, heartsick on the open sea,
fighting to save his life and bring his comrades home.

But he could not save them from disaster, hard as he strove—
the recklessness of their own ways destroyed them all,
the blind fools, they devoured the cattle of the Sun
and the god snuffed out their day of return.

Launch out on his story, Muse, daughter of Zeus,
start from where you will—sing for our time too.

By now, all the survivors, all who avoided headlong death
were safe at home, escaped the wars and waves.
But one man alone...

That man was hardened in war, Odysseus of Ithaca,
fighting his way home through storm and strife.

The wind that day whipped up the waves to a fury,
and the sky turned black as Poseidon roared in anger.

A storm unlike any seen before, crashing upon the ship,
tearing the mast asunder, sending men to the depths.

The gods watched in silence, fates intertwining,
destinies sealed by whispers carried on the wind.
